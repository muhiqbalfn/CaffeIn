    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    CB:11:96:47:CD:00:06:61:62:F7:97:72:93:2D:C6:B4:CF:8E:A5:EF

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    CB:11:96:47:CD:00:06:61:62:F7:97:72:93:2D:C6:B4:CF:8E:A5:EF

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    string in this file.
